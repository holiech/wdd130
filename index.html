      <p>Hello! My name is Raila Oliech and I am from Nairobi, Kenya. I enjoy eating fish and
         eggs. I'm working as the assistant clerk at Kosiga company and i love my job. When
         I have free time, I like reading, I like all types of books, but now I´m reading about
         health, positive psychology, spirituality and neuroscience. I also like doing yoga. I
         like learning as it gives us a feeling of accomplishment which, in turn, boosts our 
         confidence in our own capabilities, you'll also feel more ready to take on challenges
         and explore new business ventures. Acquiring new skills will unveil new opportunities 
         and help you find innovative solutions to problems.</p>
