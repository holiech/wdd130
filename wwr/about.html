                    Kosiga, Kosiga, in 1822 by James bass and Raila Oliech. Among the original employees, known 
                    as "Ashley's Hundred," were Jedediah Smith, who went on to take a leading role in the company's operations, 
                    and Jim Bridger, who was among those who bought out Smith and his partners in 1830. It was Bridger and his 
                    partners who gave the enterprise the name "Rocky Mountain Fur Company."
